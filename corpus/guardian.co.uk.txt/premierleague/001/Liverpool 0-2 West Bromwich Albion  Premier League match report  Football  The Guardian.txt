Liverpool 0-2 West Bromwich Albion  Premier League match report  Football  The Guardian
Liverpool required no reminder of what life was like before they spent £12m on Daniel Sturridge. West Bromwich Albion inflicted a quick recap nevertheless. A dominant display with no cutting edge, the opposition goalkeeper in commanding form and doubts creeping into Brendan Rodgers' team before succumbing to a late blow from a set piece: it was the return of the tale Anfield had tried to forget.

With Sturridge nursing a thigh strain on the sidelines, the momentum and threat Liverpool thought were improving after draws at Arsenal and Manchester City disappeared with him. Not that the England international would have guaranteed a way past Ben Foster. The Albion keeper was outstanding as he twice repelled Steven Gerrard, once from the penalty spot, to give Steve Clarke a second Premier League win over Liverpool since leaving the club last summer. Albion's first league double over Liverpool since 1967 tasted all the sweeter for Clarke, having arrived at Anfield without a win in 2013.

"Kenny [Dalglish] sent me a text earlier on to wish me good luck," revealed Clarke, who was Liverpool's assistant manager under Dalglish. "I'm not sure he meant it, mind. He was probably wearing a red and white scarf as he sent it."

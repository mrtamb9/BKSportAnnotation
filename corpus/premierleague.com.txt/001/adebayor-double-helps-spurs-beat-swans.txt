Two goals from Emmanuel Adebayor helped Tottenham overcome a determined Swansea side for their first win in six Barclays Premier League matches.

Spurs went in front when Rafael van der Vaart sidefooted home but Swansea threatened to extend Tottenham's disappointing run of results when Gylfi Sigurdsson fired in from outside the area.

But Adebayor headed in from a centre by Van der Vaart in the 73rd minute and then Aaron Lennon crossed for the forward to finish off and see Tottenham go level on points with third-placed Arsenal.

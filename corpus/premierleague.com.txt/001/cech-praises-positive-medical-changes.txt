Petr Cech receives treatment after suffering a horrific injury against Reading in 2006

Chelsea keeper Petr Cech has paid tribute to the developments regarding medical facilities in and around football matches after Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest.

Muamba collapsed during the FA Cup quarter-final at Tottenham on Saturday, but after receiving attention on the pitch he was taken to the London Chest Hospital.

The 23-year-old is in intensive care but showed signs of improvement on Monday, recognising family members and responding to questions.

    "Fabrice has a better chance to survive because of all the medical equipment around the pitch"
    - Petr Cech

Cech admits it has made him think back to when he had to undergo surgery for a depressed skull fracture after a collision with Reading's Stephen Hunt in a Barclays Premier League match in 2006.

He told Chelsea's official website: "I was watching the game and I was glad that after the incident that happened with me at Reading, where it took so much time to get me off the pitch and people couldn't get me out of the dressing room, imagine if that had happened with Fabrice. Back then he might have had no chance.

"I was glad to see that since then, all the medical issues and structures have changed for the better and now he has a better chance to survive because of all the medical equipment around the pitch.

"It's a great change because sometimes it can only take a few seconds to change our lives and it's good now that after what happened with me at Reading, people have got the facilities and medical rules improved."
Widespread support

Cech says Saturday's scenes from White Hart Lane stunned all the Chelsea players, with the Blues in FA Cup action against Leicester City the day after.

Defender Gary Cahill revealed a 'Pray 4 Muamba' T-shirt after scoring Chelsea's opener, and Cech says the whole club is rooting for Muamba to get better.

"You could see that Gary had a message, everybody at the club made a statement prior to the game," added Cech. "All the players hope he will be able to recover, and obviously for his family, our thoughts are with them because it's going to be a very difficult time for everybody close to him.

    "Everything we have put in place since Petr Cech helped Fabrice at least have a chance"
    - Richard Scudamore

"We tried to win the game and do our best, the guys had the message and you could see they were desperate to score to show it.

"You feel for the family and the people who are close to him and the players that are on the pitch because it's difficult. Unlike my injury, with this one you knew straight away how serious it was.

"Everybody made the correct decision to stop the game because I don't think the players would have had the concentration to continue."

On Tuesday, Premier League Chief Executive Richard Scudamore said procedures would be reviewed in the wake of Muamba's collapse, just as they were when Cech suffered his injury six years ago.

"Incidents and events shape policy, shape developments, shape progress," said Scudamore. "We will look at every aspect of what happened - just like we did after Petr Cech - and if there are ways and means of improving we will do everything we can.

"In some ways, Fabrice's life, if it is saved - and let's hope it has been saved - is as a result of the things a lot of us put in place after what happened with Petr.

"If you saw what happened on Saturday, the immediate attention, everybody comes out of this with huge credit, the referee, the match officials, the way the medics were there.

"[Then Chelsea manager] Jose Mourinho made some strident comments about the treatment that Petr got. Everything that we've put in place since helped Fabrice at least have a chance."

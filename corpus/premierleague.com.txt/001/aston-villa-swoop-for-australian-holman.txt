Aston Villa have announced the signing of Australian midfielder Brett Holman from Dutch club AZ Alkmaar.

The 27-year-old will move to Villa Park in the summer when his contract expires in the Netherlands.

Holman usually plays on the wing or as a second striker, and he has won 53 caps for Australia since making his debut for the 'Socceroos' in 2006.

He told Aston Villa's official website: "I'm delighted to have agreed terms with Villa and I am looking forward to joining up with the team in the summer.

"Villa have a long and prestigious history in English football and a fantastic set of fans.

"In the meantime I have a job to do with AZ in trying to finish the season as Eredivisie champions, as cup winners and progressing as far as possible in the UEFA Europa League."

Villa manager Alex McLeish revealed his delight at signing a player who scored twice in three matches at the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa.

"Brett is a very intelligent player, a great team player and a man who is recognised in the game as a non-stop, committed wide midfield player," said McLeish.

"He has international experience and he has played in the Champions League and at European level for the past few years. He will add significantly to the experience in the Villa squad."

Holman began his career in Australia with Parramatta Power before joining Feyenoord in 2002. He has also played for SBV Excelsior and NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch league.

Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen was the unlikely hero as he struck in the fifth minute of injury time to beat Newcastle in a thrilling finish to the match at the Emirates Stadium.

Newcastle opened the scoring when Hatem Ben Arfa cut in from the right and fired in a shot that beat Wojciech Szczesny low to his left, but Arsenal hit back inside a minute when the lively Theo Walcott set up Robin van Persie to score his 26th goal of this Barclays Premier League season.

Arsenal missed a host of chances through Tomas Rosicky, Van Persie and then a late flurry of opportunities from Gervinho, Vermaelen and Walcott.

But deep into stoppage time Vermaelen popped up to prod home and give Arsenal the win that sees them move a point behind rivals Tottenham in third place.

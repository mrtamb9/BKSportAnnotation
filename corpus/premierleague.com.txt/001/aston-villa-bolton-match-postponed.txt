Bolton Wanderers' Barclays Premier League match at Aston Villa on Tuesday has been postponed.

The decision has been made after Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed in Saturday's FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur.

However, Tottenham's home encounter against Stoke City on Wednesday at White Hart Lane will go ahead as planned with a 7.45pm kick-off.

Muamba had a cardiac arrest on the pitch just before half-time and, after lengthy medical help, he was taken to the London Chest Hospital's Heart Attack Centre, where it was confirmed he is in a critically ill condition.

A Premier League statement read: "Following Fabrice Muamba's admission to hospital yesterday evening the Premier League and Aston Villa have agreed to Bolton Wanderers' request to postpone the Barclays Premier League match between the two clubs scheduled for Tuesday 20th March.

"The match will be rearranged at a future date following appropriate consultation with the clubs.

"The thoughts of the Premier League, its clubs and players are with Fabrice Muamba, his family and Bolton Wanderers at this difficult time."

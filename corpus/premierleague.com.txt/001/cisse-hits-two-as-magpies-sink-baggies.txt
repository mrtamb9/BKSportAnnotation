Papiss Cisse hit two as Newcastle United found their away form to stay in the hunt for Champions League qualification with a win at West Bromwich Albion.

The Magpies - who had just one away win in 2012 before the match at the Hawthorns - raced into a 2-0 lead inside 12 minutes thanks to Cisse's side-footed opener and Hatem Ben Arfa's crisp finish.

Ben Arfa then turned provider for Cisse with 11 minutes of the first half to go, as the Senegalese forward fired in his fifth goal for the Magpies.

Shane Long capitalised on a mix-up between Mike Williamson and Tim Krul to pull one back for the Baggies, but Newcastle held on for a win which moved them level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea.

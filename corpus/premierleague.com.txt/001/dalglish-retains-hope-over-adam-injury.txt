Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish says midfielder Charlie Adam may still be able to play again for the club this season.

Adam, 26, limped out of the 3-2 defeat at Queens Park Rangers on 21st March with a knee ligament injury and was forced out of the 2-1 reverse at home to Wigan Athletic last weekend.

But Dalglish has rejected reports that Scottish international Adam will not play again this campaign.

    "We haven't ruled him out for the rest of the season. We're just waiting to see how he progresses"

"We know Charlie has strained knee ligaments but we still don't know how long he will be out," Dalglish told the club's official website.

"He hasn't had an operation and as it stands he's not having one. It's only been a week since he did it. He needs to rest it for another 10 days or so and then he will be reassessed.

"We'll see how he is then and we'll be in a better position to know when he will be back playing.

"We haven't ruled him out for the rest of the season. We're just waiting to see how he progresses."

As well as Adam, Liverpool are also dealing with injuries to Craig Bellamy, Martin Kelly, Daniel Agger and Glen Johnson.

Dalglish added: "They are all making progress. They are all training to various degrees and we will monitor them throughout the week.

"If they're ready to play they will come back into our plans for Sunday."

Liverpool lie seventh in the Barclays Premier League table and they travel to sixth-placed Newcastle United on Sunday.

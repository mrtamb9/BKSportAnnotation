Swansea midfielder Leon Britton has signed a new three-year deal which commits him to the club until 2015.

Britton, 29, has been a regular during the Swans' impressive debut season in the Barclays Premier League.

The player first joined the Welsh club in 2002 - and re-signed in January 2011, following a six-month stint at Sheffield United.

He said he was happy to to see out his career at the Liberty Stadium.

"I'm pleased to complete the deal," Britton told Swansea's website.

"It was an easy decision for me to make, although I still find it strange when I look back to the day I left for Sheffield United.

"I didn't even think I would be back in Swansea colours, let alone playing for the club in the Premier League armed with a new three-year contract.

"That will take me up to my 32nd birthday, but I'd like to think that if I can keep myself fit and healthy, live my life right, then I can go on until my mid to late thirties.

"In an ideal world I'd like to stay at Swansea until the day I retire - or they retire me! - because I love it here and the club has a bright future ahead of it.

"Our debut season in the Barclays Premier League has gone well so far and everyone wants to build on that. If we all stick together then, like I said, the future is bright."

Britton became the first player in Barclays Premier League history to record perfect passing stats after he successfully made all 67 passes against Bolton last October.

Newcastle United 2-0 Liverpool

Two goals from Papiss Cisse saw Newcastle beat Liverpool to maintain their hopes of challenging for a place in the top four.

Cisse headed the opener from a Hatem Ben Arfa cross in a first-half that saw Liverpool go close through Craig Bellamy's deflected cross that hit the bar and fellow ex-Magpie Andy Carroll, who headed narrowly over.

Mike Williamson headed against the post early in the second half for Newcastle before Cisse added a second when he kept his cool to slot home from close range.

Liverpool finished the match with Jose Enrique in goal after Pepe Reina was sent off, as they had already used all three substitutes.

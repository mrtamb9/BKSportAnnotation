Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard produced a match-winning display in the Merseyside derby against Everton on his 400th appearance in the Barclays Premier League.

After Steven Pienaar shot over for Everton, the hosts took the lead in the first half when Martin Kelly teed up Steven Gerrard and he shot beautifully high into the net from 15 yards.

Gerrard doubled the lead early on after the break when he thumped past Tim Howard after superb work down the right from Luis Suarez, and Everton rarely looked like getting back into it.

Andy Carroll fired wide and Jose Enrique forced Howard to save and Gerrard sealed his hat-trick in injury time after yet more unselfish play from the outstanding Suarez.

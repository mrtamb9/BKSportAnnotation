Transfer news: Espanyol's Joan Verdu not looking for move to England
Espanyol playmaker Joan Verdu has told his agent to open contract extension talks, rather than push for a transfer.

Verdu has been heavily linked with a move to England, with Southampton believed to be keen on acquiring his services after appointing Mauricio Pochettino as their new boss.

Atletico Madrid and MLS outfit the Seattle Sounders are also said to hold an interest in the 29-year-old midfielder.

Verdu is, however, looking to prolong his association with Espanyol and would rather extend a deal which is due to expire in the summer than take on a new challenge elsewhere.

"He has given me instructions that negotiating a new deal is the main priority," said Verdu's representative Magico Diaz

Espanyol are unable to match what Verdu could earn elsewhere, but he is prepared to compromise when it comes to the signing of fresh terms.

"By talking, creative solutions can be found," added Diaz.

"I can assure everyone that there has been no type of early agreement made with anyone."

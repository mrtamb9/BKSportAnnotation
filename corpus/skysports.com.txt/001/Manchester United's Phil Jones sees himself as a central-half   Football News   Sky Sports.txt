Manchester United's Phil Jones sees himself as a central-half
Manchester United ace Phil Jones admits he sees himself as a central defender and hopes that is where he will spend most of his career.

The England international has proved highly versatile since joining from Blackburn Rovers, featuring at right-back and midfield, as well as in central defence.

He started in his preffered role against Fulham at the weekend, and he impressed alongside Chris Smalling, and he hopes that is a sign of things to come.

"I have said all along centre-half is where I feel most comfortable," said Jones.

"I understand and read the game better there.

"It was certainly not a problem playing at the back with Chris Smalling on Saturday. We have played quite a lot together for England Under 21s and we understand each other's game.

"In a way, I kind of shoot myself in the foot a bit by being able to play in other positions. But I am at Manchester United and I love playing for this club.

"I didn't have a great start to the season because of injury but hopefully I can push my way into the side and get some games under my belt, so really I am happy to play anywhere."

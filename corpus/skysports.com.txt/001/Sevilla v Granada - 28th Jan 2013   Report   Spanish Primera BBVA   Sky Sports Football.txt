Three and easy for Sevilla
Sevilla looked impressive as they recorded an easy 3-0 win at home to Granada in the Primera Division on Monday night.

Five days after an emphatic 4-0 success over Real Zaragoza in the Copa Del Rey, Sevilla dominated against relegation-threatened Granada and could have won by a bigger margin.

Geoffrey Kondogbia headed home the opener shortly after the half-hour mark and two quickfire goals in the second half from Alvaro Negredo and Gary Medel completed a convincing win.

The victory lifted Sevilla up to 11th in the table, while their opponents remained one place above the drop zone.

Sevilla started well and Jose Antonio Reyes tested visiting goalkeeper Roberto with a long-range effort before Ivan Rakitic's corner picked out Fernando Navarro, whose header went wide.

Reyes then swung in a corner which Federico Fazio got his head on the end of, Roberto parrying his effort and Fazio then missing with the rebound.

That was all in the opening 10 minutes and there was no let-up as Negredo brought another save out of the over-worked Roberto.

Granada threatened briefly when Allan Nyom got a sight of goal in the area, but he could not beat Julian.

Sevilla took a deserved lead in the 31st minute when Kondogbia headed home another outswinging Rakitic corner.

Jesus Navas tried his luck with an overhead kick which was tipped round the post by Roberto as Sevilla continued to carve out chances before the break.

They had to wait until the 71st minute to get a second, though, and again Rakitic was the provider, this time crossing from the left for Negredo to head home.

And the Croatian completed a hat-trick of assists three minutes later when his corner was fired home by Medel.

Only Roberto prevented Granada from suffering an even heavier defeat as he tipped another Kondogbia header round a post late on.

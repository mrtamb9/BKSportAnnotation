Oscar Cardozo: Benfica striker is aiming to cause an upset by knocking Chelsea out of the Champions League

Oscar Cardozo remains optimistic that Benfica can knock Chelsea out of the UEFA Champions League and does not fear the second leg at Stamford Bridge. 

Chelsea produced a disciplined performance in last week's first leg of the quarter-final tie, with Salomon Kalou's second-half goal securing an important win at Estadio da Luz.

Roberto Di Matteo's side are now strong favourites to progress to a semi-final showdown with either AC Milan or holders Barcelona ahead of Wednesday's return meeting.

However, Benfica striker Cardozo feels Chelsea had plenty of luck in Portugal and is aiming to upset the odds by firing his club into the last four.
Challenge

"I don't believe Chelsea were that superior to us in the first leg," said Cardozo in the Daily Star.

"I think that was a game with a lot of luck for the English. We don't fear playing any of the teams in the Premier League.

"We have already beaten United in the Champions League and they are better than Chelsea. Our challenge is not easy, but it is possible.

"We did not deserve to lose in Lisbon and we have a chance to strike a big blow in London.

"The key for us is to score. If Benfica controls possession, we will score goals. I am convinced the Chelsea players know it is not over.

"A lot can happen in 90 minutes and it can all turn very quickly from euphoria to disaster for Chelsea."

Jupp Heynckes: Delighted with his side's display against Real

Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes feels his side's first-leg victory over Real Madrid was fully deserved after Mario Gomez hit a late winner. 

The Bundesliga giants prevailed 2-1 in the opening leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final tie at the Allianz Arena, with Gomez netting in the 89th minute after Mesut Ozil had responded to Franck Ribery's first-half opener.

The result means Bayern are a step closer to competing in the final on home soil next month and Heynckes was delighted with his side's display.

"All in all, we deserved to win," said the coach. "Madrid started well, but we took command and played very cleverly.

"I had said we would play with passion for 90 minutes and the players did just that.
Compliment

"A great compliment to my team, they ran very hard and played a great game. They gave everything."

Goal-scorer Ribery admits he was disappointed Bayern failed to keep a clean sheet and knows his side must make the most of their chances in the second leg at the Bernabeu next Wednesday.

"We knew Real are capable of scoring lots of goals and it's a pity we conceded one," he said.

"We'll have some chances in the return leg and we have to make the most of them."

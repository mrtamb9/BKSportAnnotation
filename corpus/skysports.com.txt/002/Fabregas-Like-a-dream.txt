Cesc Fabregas: Midfielder is delighted with how his first season at Barcelona has gone

Cesc Fabregas admits his first season at Barcelona has gone better than he could have expected and says the current challenge for glory is like a 'dream'. 

The midfielder rejoined his boyhood club from Arsenal last summer and has already played an influential role in the team's success so far this season.

He scored in the European Super Cup victory over Porto back in August and was also on target when Barcelona beat Santos in the final of the FIFA Club World Cup in December.

Fabregas is also hoping to help Barcelona chase down arch-rivals Real Madrid in the Primera Liga title race, with four points separating the clubs ahead of Saturday's El Clasico.

Either side of that meeting at Camp Nou, Barcelona meet Chelsea over two legs in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals and Fabregas is delighted to be playing in so many high-profile games.
Mature

"It's much better than I expected and I have played much more than I expected," said the 24-year-old.

"I came here to learn, to get better as a player and a person and also to experience weeks like this - Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Champions League, then Real Madrid in a game which, if we win, we are back in the title race, followed by Chelsea again.

"This is all new to me. My team-mates are more used to it but for me to experience this kind of situation is a dream.

"I've learned a lot tactically. I now know my position on the pitch. I feel more mature as a player."

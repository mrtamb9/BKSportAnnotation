Roberto Di Matteo: Still believes Chelsea can finish third

Roberto Di Matteo says third place is still within Chelsea's grasp, despite his side dropping to sixth in the table. 

The Blues are now trailing Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle in the race for the final two Champions League places after the 1-1 draw with Fulham on Monday night.

But, with fixtures against Arsenal and Newcastle still to come, Di Matteo believes their destiny is still under their control.

He told Chelsea TV: "It's good that we still have to play these teams. It's still in our hands."
Demanding

The Italian has given his squad two days off in preparation for a tough run of games, which will see them play the FA Cup semi-final with Tottenham, both legs of their Champions League semi-final with Barcelona, and travel to Arsenal, all in the space of nine days.

Di Matteo continued: "It'll be very demanding physically and mentally, until the end of the season so, I think two days' break is good."

Meanwhile, Salomon Kalou has told his team-mates that they have to put the draw with Fulham behind them.

He said: "We have to forget about the game [last night] and continue to work hard because it's still possible to get the third place."

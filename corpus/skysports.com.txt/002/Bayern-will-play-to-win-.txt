Jupp Heynckes: Aware that Bayern Munich cannot afford to relax

Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes is taking nothing for granted and insists his side will be playing to win against Marseille on Tuesday. 

The German giants are firm favourites to see off French opposition and book their place in the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League.

Having secured a 2-0 first leg lead away from home, Bayern return to the Allianz Arena in midweek looking to avoid any major mishaps.

Heynckes is aware that it would be foolish of his side to take progression for granted at this stage and says they will be looking to build on their advantage, not defend it.

"We will play to win as if we have played 1-1 in the first game," he said.
Advantage

"We have, of course, a psychological advantage because of the first leg result.

"It is an outstanding starting position but we should be reminded that Marseille beat Borussia Dortmund in the group stage 3-2 after trailing 2-0."

Bayern's leading marksman Mario Gomez has echoed the words of his manager and made it clear that maximum effort and concentration is required.

"We know it will be a hard game," said the Germany international, who has netted 11 times in the competition so far this season.

"In football many crazy things can happen. We will try to win tomorrow as well but it will not be a walk in the park. Just like we scored twice there, they can do the same thing here."

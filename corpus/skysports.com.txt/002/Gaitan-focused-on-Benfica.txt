Nicolas Gaitan: Linked with numerous clubs but is focused on Benfica for the moment

Benfica playmaker Nicolas Gaitan has insisted he is not thinking about his future following fresh speculation that he could be on the move this summer. 

A number of English clubs have been linked with the 24-year-old Argentina international over the past few months, with Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea reportedly keeping tabs on his progress.

A story in the Portuguese newspaper O Jogo has suggested that Bayern Munich are the latest club to enter the chase for Gaitan and have lodged an official offer in the region of €19million (£15.8m).

It is reported that Benfica have rejected the bid but could be willing to sell for around €30m (£25m).

Gaitan is not paying much attention to the transfer talk, though, as he concentrates on performing as well as he can for Benfica for the remainder of the season.

The Portuguese side face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final, while they are also chasing a domestic title.

Gaitan said: "I am focused on my work with Benfica and the dream for us to win trophies this season."

Bastian Schweinsteiger: Focused on Champions League

Bastian Schweinsteiger says Bayern Munich are fully focused on Champions League success this season after giving up on the Bundesliga. 

The Bavarian side are eight points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund with just three games remaining.

The Champions League final will be played at Bayern's Allianz Arena in May, and the Germany midfielder says the team are now focusing on becoming the first team to lift the trophy on home soil.

They host La Liga leaders Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday night.

"It's all or nothing on Tuesday," Schweinsteiger told Sky Deutschland.
Mental strength

"We have to go to the limits and beyond, but we can do it with our fans behind us.

"It won't be easy, and it comes down to mental strength. I hope we show that mentality which is a Bayern trademark."

After Saturday's goalless draw at home to Mainz, Bayern's director of sport Christian Nerlinger echoed the midfielder's thoughts.

"Regardless of the result (against Mainz), the championship has been decided" he told Bild.

"Our focus is now on the Champions League and the German Cup."

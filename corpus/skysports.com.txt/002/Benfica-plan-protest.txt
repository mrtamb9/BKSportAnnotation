Luis Filipe Vieira: Benfica president ready to protest after Chelsea defeat

Benfica president Luis Filipe Vieira insists he will make protests to the Portuguese Football Federation after they were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League by Chelsea. 

Vieira saw his side go out at Stamford Bridge but he and his coach Jorge Jesus were fuming with the referee, Slovenian Damir Skomina.

Skomina awarded Chelsea a first-half penalty in their 2-1 win on Wednesday, while he also sent off Maxi Pereira for two bookable offences before the interval.

This came after Benfica were unhappy with what happened in the first leg when they thought they were denied a penalty when John Terry handled the ball in the box.

"Benfica along with federation will do something," Vieira insisted.

"Now I do not know if the federation has the strength to accomplish anything.

"Whether there [in Lisbon] or here, they did not allow us to eliminate Chelsea.

"Benfica were the better team and deserved to go through, but beyond the external factors which seriously damaged us - we also lacked that bit of luck.

"But we will be back [in the Champions League], Uefa and [Michel] Platini will see Benfica again on European nights."

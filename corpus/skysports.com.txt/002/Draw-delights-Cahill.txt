Gary Cahill: Delighted with Chelsea's defending at Arsenal ahead of Barca clash

Gary Cahill felt Chelsea's goalless draw with Arsenal was the perfect preparation for their UEFA Champions League clash with Barcelona. 

On the back of Wednesday's 1-0 success over Pep Guardiola's troops at Stamford Bridge Roberto Di Matteo's side held the Gunners at Emirates Stadium.

The Blues are expected to be on the back foot during Tuesday's trip to Camp Nou as the European champions look to reach back-to-back finals.

Chelsea's defence has been much improved under Di Matteo and Cahill believes the squad can take great heart from keeping the likes of Robin van Persie off the scoresheet.
Preparation

"It was great practice, coming up against the likes of Robin van Persie, who's in form this season, and is one of the best forwards in the world at the minute," explained Cahill.

"It doesn't get any harder, does it, this week, facing the likes of Messi and then Van Persie and then back to Messi and the boys?

"To keep two clean sheets in the two games we've just played is pleasing for us as a whole team."

"So to keep two clean sheets in the two games we've just played is pleasing for us as a whole team."
Luck

Cahill is backing Chelsea to get the result they need in the second leg in Barcelona, although he knows they will need lady luck on their side as well.

"I think we require similar to the home leg: a little element of luck; defensively as a whole unit everyone sticking to their task; and the concentration level," he continued.

"The other night, I think physically I've run more in games, but the concentration level had to be unbelievably high and that's what all the lads did.

"So we need that again."

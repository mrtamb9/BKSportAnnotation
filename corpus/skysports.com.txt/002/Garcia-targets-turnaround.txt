Javi Garcia: Confident Benfica can overturn a 1-0 deficit to reach the Champions League semis

Benfica's Javi Garcia is adamant that Chelsea were not the better team in last week's UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg and is determined to overturn a 1-0 deficit at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. 

Salomon Kalou's away goal has given the Blues the edge ahead of the second leg but Garcia insists Benfica are ready to battle for their European lives.

Holding midfielder Garcia, who may be asked to play as a makeshift centre-back if captain Luisao is not passed fit, admits it would be a fantastic achievement to make it through to a semi-final meeting against Barcelona.

"Benfica are a team that relishes a challenge and to win at Stamford Bridge is now our biggest challenge of the season," the Spaniard told Sky Sports.

"There was anger in the Benfica dressing room after the first leg because Chelsea were not better than us. The 1-0 score was not just and now we are concentrating on revenge.

"To reach the semi-finals of the Champions League would be incredible so this match on Wednesday is like a final that he need to win.

"Emotions are mixed because we were superior in Lisbon and we lost."
Dream

Garcia insists that Benfica will not be intimidated by the Chelsea support and will instead rise to the occasion.

He explained: "We are focused on our work and do not fear the pressure of the match. It is normal that there will be a big atmosphere at Stamford Bridge.

"We know how to defeat the Blues and for us it is important to play a perfect match and score goals.

"We have confidence in our forwards and they could be the heroes on Wednesday.

"To play a match like this is a dream for any footballer."

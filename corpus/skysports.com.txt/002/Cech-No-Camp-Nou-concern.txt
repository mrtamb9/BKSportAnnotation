Petr Cech: Believes Chelsea are capable of reaching the Champions League final

Petr Cech says a trip to Camp Nou for a crucial European showdown with Barcelona holds no fear for a buoyant Chelsea side. 

The Blues will travel to Catalunya on Tuesday for the second leg of their UEFA Champions League semi-final looking to defend a narrow 1-0 lead.

Just 90 minutes separate Chelsea from a place in the final of Europe's premier club competition, but the current holders and one of the continent's most prolific sides stand in their way.

The Blues have, however, picked up positive results in Barcelona in the not too distant past and Cech insists they will head out on the road confident of claiming a notable scalp.

He said: "We've done well in the past there and need to reproduce the same kind of performance that we did and like we have before.

"It will be really important to score an away goal as well but we seem always to score there and, hopefully, we can replicate that."

Chelsea had to soak up plenty of pressure on home soil, while riding their luck on occasions, and Cech admits they will have to dig even deeper if they are to keep Barcelona at bay for a second time.

He added: "This performance was all about the focus and concentration, to stay disciplined all the time and not give them space, even though you could run for three minutes and not see the ball.

"We had to fight from the first to the last minute. We've done the maximum we could do against such a great side.

"We've had some good results against them in the past and used that experience again.

"We made it really tight, but will have to play the same way in the second leg."

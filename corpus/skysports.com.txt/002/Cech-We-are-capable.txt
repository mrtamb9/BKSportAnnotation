Petr Cech: Wants to win Champions League

Petr Cech insists that Chelsea are capable of beating Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals. 

The Czech shot-stopper helped the Blues into the last four of the Champions League as they saw off Portuguese giants Benfica on Wednesday with a 2-1 win.

Chelsea now face the European giants, but Cech insists that they would always have had to face them if they wanted to win the title.

"You dream that you win the Champions League once in your life," he told his own website.

"We just progressed through to the next round and still have a chance to fight for the trophy.

"Now we are facing the world's best football club but it was almost a certainty that if we got far we would probably play against them. You cannot look to the left or to the right at this stage.

"Anything is possible in football and if you look back at our previous meetings you can see that almost all the matches were tight and decided by details.

"We know we are not favourites but we are not going to give up."
Hard work

Cech admits Chelsea made things harder than they needed to against Benfica.

"We got past a team that played superbly in both games. We achieved what we wanted," he said.

"But we complicated this game for ourselves unnecessarily.

"We could score a second goal much earlier and it would have sorted it out.

"We had some huge opportunities to do that but managed to add a second goal only in the additional time.

"In the end all turned out good for us and a week later nobody will ask how we progressed. The most important thing is we are in the semi-finals."

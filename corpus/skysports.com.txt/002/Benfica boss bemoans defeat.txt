Jorge Jesus: Felt his Benfica side should have won against Chelsea

Benfica coach Jorge Jesus insists his side should have beaten Chelsea, and he does not give the Premier League side a chance of against Barcelona. 

Chelsea booked their place in the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League with a 3-1 aggregate win after a 2-1 success at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.

But Jesus insists his team were the better side in both legs and should have beaten the Blues, even with only 10 men at Stamford Bridge.

"We have defeated better sides than Chelsea in the Champions League," he said.

"When you reach the quarter-finals, anything is possible, but Chelsea will have no chance against Barcelona.

"We are the ones who deserved to play against Barca.

"We have been the best team in Lisbon and London. I am very proud of my men.

"We played with 10 men for the best part of an hour and we were still the best team. We made Chelsea look ordinary."
Damaged

Jesus was very unhappy with the refereeing decision which saw Benfica reduced to 10 men in the second leg.

"Maxi Pereira's red card and the penalty make no sense. We do not understand how decisions like these are made in the quarter-finals," he said.

"We were clearly damaged by the referee.

"I want to congratulate my players because they played against Chelsea and the referee.

"We were defeated by details which have nothing to do with either club."

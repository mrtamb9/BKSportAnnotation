Roberto Di Matteo: Continues to snub questions regarding his own future

Chelsea interim first-team coach Roberto Di Matteo refused to directly discuss his credentials to become the club's permanent manager ahead of the UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg against Benfica. 

The match will mark a month since the Italian succeeded the sacked Andre Villas-Boas and those four-and-a-half weeks have witnessed a turnaround in the Stamford Bridge outfit's fortunes.

Six wins and a draw from eight games have sparked a clamour for former Chelsea midfielder Di Matteo to be given the job on a full-time basis, something that will only grow on Wednesday night unless trouble strikes against Benfica.

But the ex-West Brom boss continued to snub questions about his own future and when asked why he was so reluctant to declare he wanted to manage such a fantastic club full-time, he said: "It's a fantastic club, I'll agree with you on that.
Results business

"I need to win games, it's as simple as that. It's a results business and that's all that matters."

Ending Chelsea's agonising wait for Champions League glory - something that looked an impossibility a month ago - would make Di Matteo's claim to the job impossible to ignore.

But, again, he would not go into whether the Blues were capable of lifting the European Cup and his own dreams of doing so.

He said: "I don't think about that. I have no time to think about that anyway. I'm full on in my work all day to prepare the team tactically and physically for the next game.

"There's so little time between games as well, so I haven't really sat down and thought about that."

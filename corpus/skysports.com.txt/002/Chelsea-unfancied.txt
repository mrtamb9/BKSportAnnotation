Chelsea: Outside bet for Champions League

Chelsea are 9/1 in Sky Bet's UEFA Champions League betting to win the competition for the first time after setting up a semi-final clash with Barcelona. 

The Blues defeated 10-man Benfica 2-1 to line up a crunch clash with Pep Guardiola's side, who remain 5/6 favourites to become the first team to retain their Champions League crown.

Roberto Di Matteo's side are 100/30 to qualify for the final in Munich with the Primera Liga outfit 1/5 to progress.

The other semi-final sees 12/5 second favourites Real Madrid take on Bayern Munich (9/2), with Jose Mourinho's men 1/2 to reach their first European showpiece since 2002.

Bayern are 4/9 to reach the final on home soil and Sky Bet's Live Football Manager Joe Petyt reckons they could spring a surprise at the Allianz Arena.

He said: "Barcelona are big favourites to retain the title, but Bayern could be a good bet if they can find a way past Real as they will have home advantage.

"Chelsea are the outsiders at the moment and they have a poor Champions League record against Barca - so punters will be backing the Spanish side to reach their third final in four years."

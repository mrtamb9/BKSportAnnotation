Salomon Kalou believes 'anything is possible' as Chelsea ready themselves for a UEFA Champions League semi-final showdown against Barcelona. 

A 2-1 victory over Benfica on Wednesday saw the Blues book their safe passage into the last four, with Portuguese opposition disposed of 3-1 on aggregate.

Barca now lie in wait, with the reigning European champions having blazed a trail through this season's competition.

They are considered to be the team to beat, but Chelsea are in optimistic mood heading into a two-legged tie against a side they have seen plenty of in recent years.

"For most people Barcelona are the best team in the world, but in two matches anything is possible," said Kalou.

"I believe that in a Champions League match you can never underestimate an opponent.

"For most people Barcelona are the best team in the world, but in two matches anything is possible."

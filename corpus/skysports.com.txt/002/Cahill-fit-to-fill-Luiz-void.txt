David Luiz: Set to miss Chelsea's crunch clash with Barcelona on Wednesday

David Luiz is set to miss Chelsea's clash with Barcelona on Wednesday but fellow defender Gary Cahill has handed the Blues a fitness boost. 

Cahill was injured in Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final win over Tottenham at Wembley on Sunday but trained as usual the following day.

But Luiz remains a doubt due to the hamstring injury that forced him off on a stretcher at the weekend.

Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard accepts the injury bulletin is a blow but is grateful for the squad depth at the club.

"Luiz might be fairly bad but Cahill will be all right," said Lampard. "Fortunately we have back-up.

"Branislav Ivanovic is suspended for the league games but he will be around to face Barcelona.

"It is a shame for David personally and for us as a team because he is such a good player."
Memories

Lampard's stunning 30-yard free-kick lit up Wembley on Sunday evening -sparking memories of Paul Gascoigne's famous strike on the same stage 21 years earlier.

And the 33-year-old England international freely admits it already ranks as one of his favourite goals.

Lampard added: "I hit one a few years ago against Ipswich in the cup, but to do it against Tottenham at Wembley makes it one of my favourites.

"I think Gazza's might have been another few yards and right in the top corner, I don't know.

"I grew up on that and you couldn't fail to be amazed at the strike he hit that time."

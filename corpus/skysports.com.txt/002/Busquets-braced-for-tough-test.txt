Sergio Busquets: Ready for a difficult clash against Chelsea in the Champions League

Sergio Busquets is confident Barcelona will make it through to another UEFA Champions League final but is anticipating a tricky tie against Chelsea. 

The two teams played out an extremely close, and highly controversial, semi-final three years ago which saw Barca progress on away goals thanks to a last-minute strike from Andres Iniesta in the second leg.

They are now preparing to meet at the same stage of this season's competition and Busquets is looking forward to Wednesday's first leg at Stamford Bridge.

He has no problem with Barca being favourites but concedes that it would be wrong to take anything for granted against a dangerous Chelsea side.

"I hope for a tie that it is not as agonising as last time when Iniesta scored in stoppage-time," the midfielder told Sky Sports.

"We know that it will be difficult and it is important to be focused from the first minute because Chelsea have shown a lot of inconsistency this season and this is the big danger for us.

"But we are optimistic and dream of the Champions League final.

"Barca do not fear being favourites in this tie. We are a club that always lives with this pressure and the players are used to it."
Battle

Lionel Messi will be regarded as the main threat to Chelsea after another superb campaign but Busquets does not believe they are too reliant on the Argentine superstar.

"Leo Messi is unique but Barca have many key men in this team," he explained. "We do not win only because of him. It is because of the whole group.

"The key for Wednesday will be to maintain our style and score goals.

"We have analysed how Chelsea play and it is vital to control the ball.

"The battle with Lampard, Mata, etc, is very attractive for any player. These are the matches that I always dreamed of playing as a child and now I am very happy to be doing so."

The good and the bad of Beckham 9 January 2013 Last updated at 12:49 GMT David Beckham is considering offers from Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America, but will base his family in London wherever he ends up. The former England captain has been living in Los Angeles since 2007 but will move after leaving LA Galaxy. Beckham, 37, will hold a series of meetings with his advisors next week as he nears a decision about his future. However, French Ligue 2 side Monaco are understood to have ended their interest in the midfielder after holding talks. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player ended his five-and-a-half-year stint at LA Galaxy in December. The schooling of Beckham's four children is a priority but he is still weighing up offers from various continents. Beckham joined Manchester United as a 14-year-old and went on to make 398 appearances for the club, winning six Premier League titles and the Champions League. He moved to Real Madrid in a &#xA3;25m deal in 2003 and won the La Liga title in 2007 before joining LA Galaxy. Beckham won the MLS Cup twice during his time in America and his last match was the 2012 MLS Cup final, where he helped his side beat Houston Dynamo 3-1. The midfielder, who made his England debut against Moldova in 1996 and captained the side from 2000 to 2006, made his 115th and final appearance for the national side in a 3-0 win against Belarus in 2009. He was at Upton Park on Saturday as West Ham drew 2-2 with Manchester United in the FA Cup third round, but Hammers boss Sam Allardyce would not be drawn on potential interest in signing Beckham. French side Paris Saint-Germain have expressed an interest in signing Beckham, who has also been linked with moves to Russia, China, Australia and Brazil. Beckham is expected to decide his playing future next week.

9 January 2013 Last updated at 20:44 GMT Former Chelsea assistant manager Ray Wilkins says Manchester United would be a perfect destination for Frank Lampard if he leaves Stamford Bridge. The 34-year-old's deal expires in the summer and there is no sign of a contract extension. Wilkins, who played for Chelsea and United, says the midfielder would win more medals if he moved to the Reds. "He'll want to continue to win and play at a high level, and there's no higher level than Old Trafford," said Wilkins. Premier League title: 2004-05, 2005-06,2009-10 FA Cup: 2006-07, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12 League Cup: 2004-05, 2006-07 Champions League: 2011-12 Lampard, who has won three Premier League titles and a Champions League with Chelsea, says he thinks he has "a good few more years" left at the top level. Wilkins maintains that United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is the ideal manager to get the best from Lampard, given his handling of 39-year-old Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, 38. "You have the master of utilising the older player in Sir Alex Ferguson so I think it would be a tremendous move for Frank and a good one for Manchester United as well," Wilkins told BBC Radio Manchester. "He's getting older but the knowledge of how to play the experience he's gained over the years will always stand him in good stead. "You only have to see the performances Giggs and Scholes themselves have put in over the last few years, and they are four years older than Frank." Former England international Wilkins does not think that Lampard would have any problems winning over the United fans after 10 years with one of their main rivals. "He'll win them over because of his footballing ability. If you look at Old Trafford, if anything they lack goals from the middle of the pitch," he added. Meanwhile, Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo says he would relish the chance to play alongside Lampard. "They would be mad to let him leave Chelsea. He's still one of the best in the world," said the 33-year-old Italy international. "If he wants to play in Italy I would welcome him to Juventus with open arms. Lampard could have another four years at the top in Italy." Chelsea fans chanted "sign him up" when Lampard came on as a substitute in the 5-1 FA Cup win at Southampton on Saturday.

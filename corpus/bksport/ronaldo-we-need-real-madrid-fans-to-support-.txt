The coach's name was heckled when it was announced prior to Blancos' 4-0, Copa del Rey victory over Celta Vigo, with fans particularly unhappy with Iker Casillas' recent exclusion from the side and their poor Liga form.

While Mourinho was absent at the post-match press conference, Ronaldo - who struck a hat-trick in a superb individual display - called on fans to aid the team's pursuit of trophies by displaying their support in a positive manner.

"We must stand united and we need the fans to support us, there is still a lot to win," he told reporters.

The Portugal international's man-of-the-match display was saluted by Sergio Ramos after the game, though the evening ended on a more sour note for the defender after he was sent off.

"Ronaldo is very motivated, and I can see he is happy," the Spain defender said.

 "He deserves his standing ovation and that affection. He's the best in the world."

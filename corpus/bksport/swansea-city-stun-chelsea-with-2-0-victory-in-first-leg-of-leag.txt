Source: Matt Dunham / AFP Two horrible Branislav Ivanovic errors gave Swansea a huge advantage in their Capital One Cup semi-final with Chelsea after a 2-0 first-leg win at Stamford Bridge The defender's failure to control a ball on the edge of his own penalty area gave Michu the chance to open the scoring in the first half against the run of play.Chelsea, who started with Fernando Torres instead of January signing Demba Ba, dominated but Danny Graham made it 2-0 in injury time when pouncing on Ivanovic's blind back-pass.The European champions had a claim for a penalty, which saw Ba booked for diving, immediately before Graham's goal but they must now overcome two away goals in the second leg.But interim boss Benitez heard his team booed off at the final whistle and they must now overcome two away goals in the second leg.Chelsea's fans spent a large chunk of the match berating Benitez for his failure to bring on Ba, who scored twice on debut last weekend, and they also took umbrage with the interim boss' failure to bring on Frank Lampard until the 70th minute.The Blues dominated the game, but lacked a killer touch up front and they paid the price in the 39th minute when Ivanovic's blunder gifted Michu the chance to score his 16th goal of the season.Start of sidebar.

Ivanovic's second terrible back-pass allowed Graham to pinch the ball off Turnbull before slotting in to an empty net.

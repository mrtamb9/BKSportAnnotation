Massimiliano Allegri was satisfied with his players despite seeing his AC Milan team knocked out of the Coppa Italia quarter-finals by Juventus.

The Rossoneri seized the early initiative when Italy striker Stephan El Shaarawy put the away side ahead, but the game was turned on its head following Sebastian Giovinco's equaliser and Mirko Vucinic's extra-time winner.

The former Cagliari coach felt his side's performance was undermined by a self-inflicted error for the Bianconeri's winning goal, coupled with goalkeeping heroics, as they pressed for the goal that would have taken the game to penalties.

"It was a balanced game and on the second goal we made a mistake in defence that allowed the counterattack," Allegri told RAI.

"In any case, I am happy with the performance because we had several chances to equalise after Vucinic 's goal.

"It 's a shame about the result, especially with Marco Storari 's final save. We can improve, but we deserved more from this match."

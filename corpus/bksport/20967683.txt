9 January 2013 Last updated at 23:04 GMT Blackburn Rovers have approached Blackpool for permission to speak to Tangerines boss Michael Appleton about the managerial vacancy at Ewood Park. Rovers sacked Henning Berg on 27 December but have won their last three games under caretaker Gary Bowyer. Appleton, 37, only joined Blackpool from Portsmouth in November as a replacement for Ian Holloway. Rovers managing director Derek Shaw said : "He is the only candidate we have approached." Appleton has only won two games since taking charge at Bloomfield Road, drawing eight and losing two, and has won just 15 games since making his managerial debut for Pompey in November 2011. Blackpool's last win came against Blackburn on 15 December and the two sides are one place apart in the Championship table. Rovers are in 13th place, five points short of the play-off places and one point above Blackpool. A short Blackpool statement confirmed that Rovers had made an approach for their manager. Last week, Rovers global advisor Shebby Singh told BBC Radio Lancashire that the club wanted their next manager to accept a short-term contract. Singh said: "If somebody has got the ambition, the knowledge and the experience, there will be people who will take the job. "We are looking to offer a short-term contract with specific targets, and upon achieving those targets it will trigger a longer-term contract."

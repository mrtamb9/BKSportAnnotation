Three for me ... Cristiano Ronaldo scores another stunning hat-trick for Madrid. Source: Daniel Ochoa De Olza / AFP Cristiano Ronaldo responded to missing out on the Ballon d'Or by hitting a stunning hat-trick in Real Madrid's 4-0 defeat of Celta Vigo to reach the Spanish Cup soccer quarter-finals. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg of their last-16 tie, Portuguese star Ronaldo struck twice early before settling the outcome with three minutes remaining to calm his team's nerves after Sergio Ramos had been sent off with 17 minutes to go.Sami Khedira added the fourth in the final minute and Jose Mourinho's men will meet Valencia in the next round before a potential semi-final tie with eternal rivals Barcelona who knocked Madrid out last season at the quarter-final stage.Mourinho recalled goalkeeper Iker Casillas for the clash after he had controversially dropped the club captain to the bench for the past two La Liga games.Ronaldo, beaten to the Ballon d'Or by Lionel Messi, hit a sensational opener after only two minutes.Receiving the ball from a short throw-in, the Portuguese hit an unstoppable shot from wide on the left that fizzed and then bent before beating Sergio in the Celta goal at his far post.It was the same man who hit a shot over the bar from long range 10 minutes later, before he doubled his side's lead with one delicate touch on 23 minutes to finish off a Luka Modric through ball.Start of sidebar.

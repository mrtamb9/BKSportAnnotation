Hoarau, a full France international with five caps to his name, saw his role at Paris Saint-Germain diminish following the recruitment of several expensive forwards by coach Carlo Ancelotti.

Although the 28-year-old's exit was almost inevitable, Jallet admitted his departure was difficult to take after seeing his team-mate move all the way to China secure regular football.

"It is difficult for me because we were pretty close," he told TF1.

"China is his choice and it must be respected [but] we would have liked him not to go as far.

 "I have another point of view in that I would not want to live there." 

Hoarau will link up with former Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita at his new club, based in the north-east province of Liaoning.
